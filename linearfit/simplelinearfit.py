Generates the linear fit matrix M defined as M[i,(j,l)] = g_j(x_i,l),
i = 1,...n is the number of data points

l=1,...,k is the data point dimensionality
where {g_j}_j=0...,dim span the function subspace for the fit and
the k-dimensional data points {x_i}_i=1,...,n have the one-dimensional
label values {y_i}. The default subspace is defined as the span of the
functions g_0 :=1, g_j(x) := exp(j*x), j=1,...,dim
